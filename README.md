# Bucket Swap Algorithm

This is a visual effect algorithm that processes a video sequence, frame by frame, swapping semi-random (generally localized) sets of pixels from neighboring iamges in the frame sequence. These sets of pixels will be referred to as buckets for simplicity. 
- Neightboring image here means the preceding frame(s), and proceeding frame(s). Pixels from neighboring frames (buckets) are then "mixed" together, to produce a dreamy look to the video sequence.
- Here is an example of the effect:

The effect was used a lot in the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPwq3rCTa50
