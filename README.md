# Bucket Swap Algorithm

This is a visual effect algorithm that processes a video sequence, frame by frame, swapping certain semi-random (yet generally local) sets of pixels from neighboring iamges in the frame sequence. These sets of pixels will be referred to as buckets for simplicity. 
- by neightboring image, I mean pixels from the preceding frame(s), and proceeding frame(s). These pixels are then "mixed" together, tp produce a kind of dreamy look to the video sequence.
